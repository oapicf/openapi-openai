Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is  committed by the client or server (in `server_vad` mode). Transcription runs  asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after  the Response events.  Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a  separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model,  currently always `whisper-1`. Thus the transcript may diverge somewhat from  the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide. ",
