/*
 * AssistantStreamEvent.h
 *
 * Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.  Each event in a server-sent events stream has an &#x60;event&#x60; and &#x60;data&#x60; property:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; event: thread.created data: {\&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;thread_123\&quot;, \&quot;object\&quot;: \&quot;thread\&quot;, ...} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit &#x60;thread.run.created&#x60; when a new run is created, &#x60;thread.run.completed&#x60; when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a &#x60;thread.message.created event&#x60;, a &#x60;thread.message.in_progress&#x60; event, many &#x60;thread.message.delta&#x60; events, and finally a &#x60;thread.message.completed&#x60; event.  We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

/*! \brief Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.  Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:  ``` event: thread.created data: {\"id\": \"thread_123\", \"object\": \"thread\", ...} ```  We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a `thread.message.completed` event.
