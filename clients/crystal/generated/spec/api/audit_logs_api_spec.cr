  # List user actions and configuration changes within this organization.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [ListAuditLogsEffectiveAtParameter] :effective_at Return only events whose &#x60;effective_at&#x60; (Unix seconds) is in this range.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :project_ids Return only events for these projects.
  # @option opts [Array(AuditLogEventType)] :event_types Return only events with a &#x60;type&#x60; in one of these values. For example, &#x60;project.created&#x60;. For all options, see the documentation for the [audit log object](/docs/api-reference/audit-logs/object).
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :actor_ids Return only events performed by these actors. Can be a user ID, a service account ID, or an api key tracking ID.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :actor_emails Return only events performed by users with these emails.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :resource_ids Return only events performed on these targets. For example, a project ID updated.
  # @option opts [Int32] :limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20. 
  # @option opts [String] :after A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;after&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after&#x3D;obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list. 
  # @option opts [String] :before A cursor for use in pagination. &#x60;before&#x60; is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include before&#x3D;obj_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
