class CHAT_COMPLETION_STREAM_OPTIONS




feature --Access

    include_usage: BOOLEAN
      -- If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the `data: [DONE]` message. The `usage` field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics for the entire request, and the `choices` field will always be an empty array. All other chunks will also include a `usage` field, but with a null value. 

feature -- Change Element

    set_include_usage (a_name: like include_usage)
        -- Set 'include_usage' with 'a_name'.
      do
        include_usage := a_name
      ensure
        include_usage_set: include_usage = a_name
