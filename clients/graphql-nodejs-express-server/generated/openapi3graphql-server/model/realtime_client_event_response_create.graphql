# This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering  model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses  automatically.  A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case  the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the  conversation history.  The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items  and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the  Response is complete.  The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like  `instructions`, and `temperature`. These fields will override the Session's  configuration for this Response only.
