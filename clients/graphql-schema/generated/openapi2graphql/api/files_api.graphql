The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for details.  The Fine-tuning API only supports &#x60;.jsonl&#x60; files. The input also has certain required formats for fine-tuning [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.  The Batch API only supports &#x60;.jsonl&#x60; files up to 200 MB in size. The input also has a specific required [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).  Please [contact us](https://help.openai.com/) if you need to increase these storage limits. 
  # @param String! file The File object (not file name) to be uploaded. 
  # @param String! purpose The intended purpose of the uploaded file.  Use \\\&quot;assistants\\\&quot; for [Assistants](/docs/api-reference/assistants) and [Message](/docs/api-reference/messages) files, \\\&quot;vision\\\&quot; for Assistants image file inputs, \\\&quot;batch\\\&quot; for [Batch API](/docs/guides/batch), and \\\&quot;fine-tune\\\&quot; for [Fine-tuning](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning). 
  # @return [OpenAiFile]
  CreateFile(file: String!, purpose: String!): OpenAiFile

  # Delete a file.
  # @param String! fileId The ID of the file to use for this request.
  # @return [DeleteFileResponse]
  DeleteFile(fileId: String!): DeleteFileResponse

  # @param String! fileId The ID of the file to use for this request.
  # @return [String!]
  DownloadFile(fileId: String!): String!

  # Returns a list of files.
  # @param String! purpose Only return files with the given purpose.
  # @param Int! limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 10,000, and the default is 10,000. 
  # @param String! order Sort order by the &#x60;created_at&#x60; timestamp of the objects. &#x60;asc&#x60; for ascending order and &#x60;desc&#x60; for descending order.
