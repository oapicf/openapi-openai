  CreateImage(createImageRequest: CreateImageRequest): ImagesResponse

  # Creates an edited or extended image given an original image and a prompt.
  # @param String! image The image to edit. Must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB, and square. If mask is not provided, image must have transparency, which will be used as the mask.
  # @param String! prompt A text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters.
  # @param String! mask An additional image whose fully transparent areas (e.g. where alpha is zero) indicate where &#x60;image&#x60; should be edited. Must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB, and have the same dimensions as &#x60;image&#x60;.
  # @param CreateImageEditRequestModel model 
  # @param Int n The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10.
  # @param String size The size of the generated images. Must be one of &#x60;256x256&#x60;, &#x60;512x512&#x60;, or &#x60;1024x1024&#x60;.
  # @param String responseFormat The format in which the generated images are returned. Must be one of &#x60;url&#x60; or &#x60;b64_json&#x60;. URLs are only valid for 60 minutes after the image has been generated.
  # @param String! user A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids). 
  # @return [ImagesResponse]

  # Creates a variation of a given image.
  # @param String! image The image to use as the basis for the variation(s). Must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB, and square.
  # @param CreateImageEditRequestModel model 
  # @param Int n The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10. For &#x60;dall-e-3&#x60;, only &#x60;n&#x3D;1&#x60; is supported.
