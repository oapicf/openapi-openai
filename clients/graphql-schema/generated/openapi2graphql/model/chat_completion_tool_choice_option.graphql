# Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. &#x60;none&#x60; means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. &#x60;auto&#x60; means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. &#x60;required&#x60; means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via &#x60;{\&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;function\&quot;, \&quot;function\&quot;: {\&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;my_function\&quot;}}&#x60; forces the model to call that tool.  &#x60;none&#x60; is the default when no tools are present. &#x60;auto&#x60; is the default if tools are present.
