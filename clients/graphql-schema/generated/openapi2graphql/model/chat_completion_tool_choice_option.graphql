# Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. &#x60;none&#x60; means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. &#x60;auto&#x60; means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via &#x60;{\&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;function\&quot;, \&quot;function\&quot;: {\&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;my_function\&quot;}}&#x60; forces the model to call that function.  &#x60;none&#x60; is the default when no functions are present. &#x60;auto&#x60; is the default if functions are present.
