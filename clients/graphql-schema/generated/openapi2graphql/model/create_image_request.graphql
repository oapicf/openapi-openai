  n: Int

  # The quality of the image that will be generated. &#x60;hd&#x60; creates images with finer details and greater consistency across the image. This param is only supported for &#x60;dall-e-3&#x60;.
  quality: Quality

  # The format in which the generated images are returned. Must be one of &#x60;url&#x60; or &#x60;b64_json&#x60;. URLs are only valid for 60 minutes after the image has been generated.
