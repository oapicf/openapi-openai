  # Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.

  # What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. 
  temperature: Float

  # An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. 
  top_p: Float

  stream: Boolean

  # The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run.
