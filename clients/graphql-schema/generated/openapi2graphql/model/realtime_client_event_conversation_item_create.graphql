# Add a new Item to the Conversation&#39;s context, including messages, function  calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a  \&quot;history\&quot; of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the  current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.  If successful, the server will respond with a &#x60;conversation.item.created&#x60;  event, otherwise an &#x60;error&#x60; event will be sent.
