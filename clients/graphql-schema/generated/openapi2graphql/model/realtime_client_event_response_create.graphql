# This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering  model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses  automatically.  A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case  the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the  conversation history.  The server will respond with a &#x60;response.created&#x60; event, events for Items  and content created, and finally a &#x60;response.done&#x60; event to indicate the  Response is complete.  The &#x60;response.create&#x60; event includes inference configuration like  &#x60;instructions&#x60;, and &#x60;temperature&#x60;. These fields will override the Session&#39;s  configuration for this Response only.
