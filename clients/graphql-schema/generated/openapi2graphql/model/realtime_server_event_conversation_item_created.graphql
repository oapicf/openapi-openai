# Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that  produce this event:   - The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce      either one or two Items, which will be of type &#x60;message&#x60;      (role &#x60;assistant&#x60;) or type &#x60;function_call&#x60;.   - The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the      server (in &#x60;server_vad&#x60; mode). The server will take the content of the      input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.   - The client has sent a &#x60;conversation.item.create&#x60; event to add a new Item      to the Conversation.
