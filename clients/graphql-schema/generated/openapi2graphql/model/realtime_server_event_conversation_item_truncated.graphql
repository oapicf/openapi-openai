# Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the  client with a &#x60;conversation.item.truncate&#x60; event. This event is used to  synchronize the server&#39;s understanding of the audio with the client&#39;s playback.  This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript  to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn&#39;t been heard by the user.
