# RealtimeResponseCreateParamsConversation

Controls which conversation the response is added to. Currently supports `auto` and `none`, with `auto` as the default value. The `auto` value means that the contents of the response will be added to the default conversation. Set this to `none` to create an out-of-band response which  will not add items to default conversation.
