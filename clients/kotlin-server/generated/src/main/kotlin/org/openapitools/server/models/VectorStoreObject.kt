/**
 * A vector store is a collection of processed files can be used by the `file_search` tool.
 * @param id The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.
 * @param `object` The object type, which is always `vector_store`.
 * @param createdAt The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was created.
 * @param name The name of the vector store.
 * @param usageBytes The total number of bytes used by the files in the vector store.
 * @param fileCounts 
 * @param status The status of the vector store, which can be either `expired`, `in_progress`, or `completed`. A status of `completed` indicates that the vector store is ready for use.
 * @param lastActiveAt The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was last active.
 * @param metadata Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.
