/**
 * 
 * @param messages A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the [model](/docs/models) you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like [text](/docs/guides/text-generation), [images](/docs/guides/vision), and [audio](/docs/guides/audio). 
 * @param model 
 * @param store Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for  use in our [model distillation](/docs/guides/distillation) or [evals](/docs/guides/evals) products. 
 * @param reasoningEffort **o1 models only**   Constrains effort on reasoning for  [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response. 
 * @param metadata Developer-defined tags and values used for filtering completions in the [dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/chat-completions). 
 * @param frequencyPenalty Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. 
 * @param logitBias Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. 
 * @param logprobs Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. 
 * @param topLogprobs An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used. 
 * @param maxTokens The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.  This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not compatible with [o1 series models](/docs/guides/reasoning). 
 * @param maxCompletionTokens An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning). 
 * @param n How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.
 * @param modalities Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:  `[\"text\"]`  The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to [generate audio](/docs/guides/audio). To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:  `[\"text\", \"audio\"]` 
 * @param prediction 
 * @param audio 
 * @param presencePenalty Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. 
 * @param responseFormat 
 * @param seed This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. 
 * @param serviceTier Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:    - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.   - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.   - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.   - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.    When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` utilized. 
 * @param stop 
 * @param stream If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions). 
 * @param streamOptions 
 * @param temperature What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. 
 * @param topP An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. 
 * @param tools A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported. 
 * @param toolChoice 
 * @param parallelToolCalls Whether to enable [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use.
 * @param user A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids). 
 * @param functionCall 
 * @param functions Deprecated in favor of `tools`.  A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
