/**
 * Represents a streamed chunk of a chat completion response returned by model, based on the provided input.
 *
 * @param id A unique identifier for the chat completion. Each chunk has the same ID.
 * @param choices A list of chat completion choices. Can contain more than one elements if `n` is greater than 1. Can also be empty for the last chunk if you set `stream_options: {\"include_usage\": true}`. 
 * @param created The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the chat completion was created. Each chunk has the same timestamp.
 * @param model The model to generate the completion.
