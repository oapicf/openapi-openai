/**
 * Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the  client with a `conversation.item.truncate` event. This event is used to  synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.  This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript  to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user. 
 *
 * @param eventId The unique ID of the server event.
 * @param type The event type, must be `conversation.item.truncated`.
 * @param itemId The ID of the assistant message item that was truncated.
 * @param contentIndex The index of the content part that was truncated.
 * @param audioEndMs The duration up to which the audio was truncated, in milliseconds.
