type ChatCompletionStreamOptions* = object
  ## Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`. 
  includeUsage*: Option[bool] ## If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the `data: [DONE]` message. The `usage` field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics for the entire request, and the `choices` field will always be an empty array. All other chunks will also include a `usage` field, but with a null value.
