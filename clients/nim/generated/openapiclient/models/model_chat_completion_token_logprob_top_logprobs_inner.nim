type ChatCompletionTokenLogprobTopLogprobsInner* = object
  ## 
  token*: string ## The token.
  logprob*: float ## The log probability of this token, if it is within the top 20 most likely tokens. Otherwise, the value `-9999.0` is used to signify that the token is very unlikely.
  bytes*: Option[seq[int]] ## A list of integers representing the UTF-8 bytes representation of the token. Useful in instances where characters are represented by multiple tokens and their byte representations must be combined to generate the correct text representation. Can be `null` if there is no bytes representation for the token.
