type CreateCompletionRequestPrompt* = object
  ## The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.  Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.
