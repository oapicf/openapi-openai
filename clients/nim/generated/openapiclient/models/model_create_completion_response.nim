type CreateCompletionResponse* = object
  ## Represents a completion response from the API. Note: both the streamed and non-streamed response objects share the same shape (unlike the chat endpoint). 
  id*: string ## A unique identifier for the completion.
  choices*: seq[CreateCompletionResponse_choices_inner] ## The list of completion choices the model generated for the input prompt.
  created*: int ## The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was created.
  model*: string ## The model used for completion.
  systemFingerprint*: string ## This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with.  Can be used in conjunction with the `seed` request parameter to understand when backend changes have been made that might impact determinism. 
  `object`*: `Object` ## The object type, which is always \"text_completion\"
  usage*: CompletionUsage
