type CreateEditRequest* = object
  ## 
  model*: CreateEditRequest_model
  input*: string ## The input text to use as a starting point for the edit.
  instruction*: string ## The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt.
  n*: int ## How many edits to generate for the input and instruction.
  temperature*: float ## What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.  We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. 
  topP*: float ## An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
