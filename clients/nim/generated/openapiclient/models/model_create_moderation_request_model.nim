type CreateModerationRequestModel* = object
  ## Two content moderations models are available: `text-moderation-stable` and `text-moderation-latest`.  The default is `text-moderation-latest` which will be automatically upgraded over time. This ensures you are always using our most accurate model. If you use `text-moderation-stable`, we will provide advanced notice before updating the model. Accuracy of `text-moderation-stable` may be slightly lower than for `text-moderation-latest`.
