type FineTuningJob* = object
  ## The `fine_tuning.job` object represents a fine-tuning job that has been created through the API. 
  id*: string ## The object identifier, which can be referenced in the API endpoints.
  createdAt*: int ## The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the fine-tuning job was created.
  error*: FineTuningJob_error
  fineTunedModel*: string ## The name of the fine-tuned model that is being created. The value will be null if the fine-tuning job is still running.
  finishedAt*: int ## The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the fine-tuning job was finished. The value will be null if the fine-tuning job is still running.
  hyperparameters*: FineTuningJob_hyperparameters
  model*: string ## The base model that is being fine-tuned.
  `object`*: `Object` ## The object type, which is always \"fine_tuning.job\".
  organizationId*: string ## The organization that owns the fine-tuning job.
  resultFiles*: seq[string] ## The compiled results file ID(s) for the fine-tuning job. You can retrieve the results with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files/retrieve-contents).
  status*: Status ## The current status of the fine-tuning job, which can be either `validating_files`, `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.
  trainedTokens*: int ## The total number of billable tokens processed by this fine-tuning job. The value will be null if the fine-tuning job is still running.
  trainingFile*: string ## The file ID used for training. You can retrieve the training data with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files/retrieve-contents).
  validationFile*: string ## The file ID used for validation. You can retrieve the validation results with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files/retrieve-contents).
  integrations*: seq[FineTuningJob_integrations_inner] ## A list of integrations to enable for this fine-tuning job.
  seed*: int ## The seed used for the fine-tuning job.
