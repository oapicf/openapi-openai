  ## Represents an execution run on a [thread](/docs/api-reference/threads).
  id*: string ## The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.
  `object`*: `Object` ## The object type, which is always `thread.run`.
  createdAt*: int ## The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was created.
  threadId*: string ## The ID of the [thread](/docs/api-reference/threads) that was executed on as a part of this run.
  assistantId*: string ## The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for execution of this run.
  status*: Status ## The status of the run, which can be either `queued`, `in_progress`, `requires_action`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `completed`, or `expired`.
  requiredAction*: RunObject_required_action
  lastError*: RunObject_last_error
  expiresAt*: int ## The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run will expire.
