Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file, where each training example is a JSON object with the keys \"prompt\" and \"completion\". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.  See the [fine-tuning guide](/docs/guides/fine-tuning/creating-training-data) for more details.
