# openapi::RealtimeClientEventConversationItemCreate

Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function  calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a  \"history\" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the  current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.  If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.created`  event, otherwise an `error` event will be sent.
