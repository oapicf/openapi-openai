  # If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the &#x60;data: [DONE]&#x60; message. The &#x60;usage&#x60; field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics for the entire request, and the &#x60;choices&#x60; field will always be an empty array. All other chunks will also include a &#x60;usage&#x60; field, but with a null value.
