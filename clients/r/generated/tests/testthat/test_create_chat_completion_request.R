Currently supported values are &#x60;low&#x60;, &#x60;medium&#x60;, and &#x60;high&#x60;. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
