  # base path: https://api.openai.com/v1
  # Creates an edited or extended image given an original image and a prompt.
  # @param image data.frame The image to edit. Must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB, and square. If mask is not provided, image must have transparency, which will be used as the mask.
  # @param prompt character A text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters.
  # @param mask data.frame An additional image whose fully transparent areas (e.g. where alpha is zero) indicate where `image` should be edited. Must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB, and have the same dimensions as `image`. (optional)
  # @param model CreateImageEditRequestModel  (optional)
  # @param n integer The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10. (optional)
  # @param size character The size of the generated images. Must be one of `256x256`, `512x512`, or `1024x1024`. (optional)
  # @param response_format character The format in which the generated images are returned. Must be one of `url` or `b64_json`. URLs are only valid for 60 minutes after the image has been generated. (optional)
  # @param user character A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).  (optional)
