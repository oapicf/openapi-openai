test_that("instructions", {
  # tests for the property `instructions` (character)
  # The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model  calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired  responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format,  (e.g. \&quot;be extremely succinct\&quot;, \&quot;act friendly\&quot;, \&quot;here are examples of good  responses\&quot;) and on audio behavior (e.g. \&quot;talk quickly\&quot;, \&quot;inject emotion  into your voice\&quot;, \&quot;laugh frequently\&quot;). The instructions are not guaranteed  to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the  desired behavior.  Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this  field is not set and are visible in the &#x60;session.created&#x60; event at the  start of the session.

  # Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.
