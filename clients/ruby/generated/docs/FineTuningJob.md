| **object** | **String** | The object type, which is always \&quot;fine_tuning.job\&quot;. |  |
| **organization_id** | **String** | The organization that owns the fine-tuning job. |  |
| **result_files** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | The compiled results file ID(s) for the fine-tuning job. You can retrieve the results with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files/retrieve-contents). |  |
| **status** | **String** | The current status of the fine-tuning job, which can be either &#x60;validating_files&#x60;, &#x60;queued&#x60;, &#x60;running&#x60;, &#x60;succeeded&#x60;, &#x60;failed&#x60;, or &#x60;cancelled&#x60;. |  |
| **trained_tokens** | **Integer** | The total number of billable tokens processed by this fine-tuning job. The value will be null if the fine-tuning job is still running. |  |
| **training_file** | **String** | The file ID used for training. You can retrieve the training data with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files/retrieve-contents). |  |
| **validation_file** | **String** | The file ID used for validation. You can retrieve the validation results with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files/retrieve-contents). |  |
| **integrations** | [**Array&lt;FineTuningJobIntegrationsInner&gt;**](FineTuningJobIntegrationsInner.md) | A list of integrations to enable for this fine-tuning job. | [optional] |
| **seed** | **Integer** | The seed used for the fine-tuning job. |  |
