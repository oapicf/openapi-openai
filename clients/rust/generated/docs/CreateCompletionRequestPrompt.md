# CreateCompletionRequestPrompt

## Enum Variants

| Name | Description |
|---- | -----|
| String | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.  Note that &lt;|endoftext|&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.  |
| Vec<String> | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.  Note that &lt;|endoftext|&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.  |
| Vec<Vec<i32>> | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.  Note that &lt;|endoftext|&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.  |
| Vec<i32> | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.
