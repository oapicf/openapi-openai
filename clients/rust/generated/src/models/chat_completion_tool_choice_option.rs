/// ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption : Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"my_function\"}}` forces the model to call that tool.  `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.
