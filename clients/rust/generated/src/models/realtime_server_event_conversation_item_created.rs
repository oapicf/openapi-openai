/// RealtimeServerEventConversationItemCreated : Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that  produce this event:   - The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce      either one or two Items, which will be of type `message`      (role `assistant`) or type `function_call`.   - The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the      server (in `server_vad` mode). The server will take the content of the      input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.   - The client has sent a `conversation.item.create` event to add a new Item      to the Conversation.
