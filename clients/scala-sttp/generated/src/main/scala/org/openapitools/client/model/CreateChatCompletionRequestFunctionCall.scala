   * Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.  Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{\"name\": \"my_function\"}` forces the model to call that function.  `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.
