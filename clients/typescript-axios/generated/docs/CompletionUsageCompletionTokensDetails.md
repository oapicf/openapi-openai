# CompletionUsageCompletionTokensDetails

Breakdown of tokens used in a completion.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**accepted_prediction_tokens** | **number** | When using Predicted Outputs, the number of tokens in the prediction that appeared in the completion.  | [optional] [default to undefined]
**audio_tokens** | **number** | Audio input tokens generated by the model. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**reasoning_tokens** | **number** | Tokens generated by the model for reasoning. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**rejected_prediction_tokens** | **number** | When using Predicted Outputs, the number of tokens in the prediction that did not appear in the completion. However, like reasoning tokens, these tokens are still counted in the total completion tokens for purposes of billing, output, and context window limits.  | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { CompletionUsageCompletionTokensDetails } from './api';

const instance: CompletionUsageCompletionTokensDetails = {
    accepted_prediction_tokens,
    audio_tokens,
    reasoning_tokens,
    rejected_prediction_tokens,
};
```
