 * Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the  client with a `conversation.item.truncate` event. This event is used to  synchronize the server\'s understanding of the audio with the client\'s playback.  This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript  to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn\'t been heard by the user.
